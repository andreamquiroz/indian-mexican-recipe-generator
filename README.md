# Indian-Mexican Recipe Generator
A generative AI project that creates authentic Indian and Mexican (with Honduran variations) recipes using machine learning techniques trained on the RecipeNLG dataset.
Overview
This project leverages natural language generation to create unique, culturally-inspired recipes by training on a curated subset of the RecipeNLG dataset. The model learns patterns from traditional Indian and Mexican cuisines to generate new recipe combinations while maintaining authentic flavor profiles and cooking techniques.
Features

Multi-Cuisine Support: Generate recipes for Indian, Mexican, and Honduran cuisines
Ingredient-Based Generation: Input available ingredients to get recipe suggestions
Cuisine Style Transfer: Adapt recipes between different cultural cooking styles
Authentic Flavor Profiles: Maintains traditional spice combinations and cooking methods
Customizable Parameters: Adjust recipe complexity, cooking time, and dietary restrictions

Dataset
This project uses the RecipeNLG dataset, a large-scale dataset containing over 2 million recipes with ingredients and cooking instructions. The dataset has been filtered and preprocessed to focus on:

Indian subcontinental recipes (Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi cuisines)
Mexican and Central American recipes (including Honduran variations)
Fusion recipes that blend these culinary traditions
